# Seasonal Signs (Local Almanac)

## Spring Onset
- Soil temp above 50°F for three consecutive mornings → safe to direct sow beans.
- Observe oak leaf size: when larger than a squirrel’s ear, corn planting window opens.
- Frog chorus resumes at dusk when overnight lows stay above 45°F → expect mosquito hatch within a week.

## Summer Indicators
- Crimson clover reseeding successfully signals adequate moisture; expect two more weeks before drought stress.
- Milky way visibility drops (humidity spike) → plan for morning dew collection to supplement water stores.
- Fireflies disappearing early often precedes dry lightning storms—stage fire watch.

## Autumn Warnings
- Geese flight path shifting west suggests prolonged easterly winds; inspect roof tie-downs.
- When goldenrod blooms, harvest and dry remaining medicinal herbs within 10 days.
- Heavy spider webbing on equipment indicates rapid temperature swings coming; prep freeze protection.

## Winter Prep
- Fresh animal tracks on south slopes while north slopes stay bare → snowline moving down; ready snow tools.
- Hoarfrost on inside of shelter at dawn => ventilation too tight, crack vents to avoid moisture rot.
- Auroral activity seen this far south? Expect geomagnetic interference; pre-stage manual navigation aids.
