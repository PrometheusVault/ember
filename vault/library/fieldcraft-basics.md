# Fieldcraft Basics (Vault Edition)

## Water
- Treat every surface source as contaminated; filter ➜ boil ➜ chemical.
- Cache nested metal containers so you can boil while transporting a second batch.
- Record reliable springs/wells in your personal log stored alongside this file.

## Fire
- Stock three ignition methods (ferro rod, storm matches, fresnel lens). Test monthly.
- Bundle rule: tinder (thumb), kindling (wrist), fuel (forearm). Stage before striking.
- Keep tinder tins inside every pack and cache extras in the shelter.

## Shelter
- Apply the 50/50 rule: spend half your effort insulating from ground, half blocking wind.
- Orient door leeward and trench for runoff. Snow: add ventilation stick to prevent CO buildup.
- Carry a mylar blanket solely for radiant reflection; avoid using it as your primary cover.

## Food
- Rotate staples quarterly. Mark buckets with packed/opened dates.
- Build a rotating list of regional edible plants with prep notes (cook time, leaching steps).
- Keep spare snare wire and small-game traps bundled with each go-bag.

## Signals
- Three of anything (whistle, fire, mirror, radio) = distress. Teach the team to acknowledge with two.
- Maintain laminated cards listing local repeater frequencies and plain-language call signs.
- Night ops: red chem lights mark safe lanes; IR strobes reserved for air support.
